/**
 * The arm subsystem. Manages the elevator, arm pitch, arm wrist rotation, and end effector. We combine all these into
 * one subsystem because they need to closely interact; most of the time, the elevator, arm pitch, and arm wrist move
 * simultaneously, and the end effector must work with the arm wrist while rotating because we use a coaxial drive
 * system for it.
